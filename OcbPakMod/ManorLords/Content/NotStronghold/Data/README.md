To edit them I used [UAssetGUI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI), for which
you will also need the correct mapping for the used game version. You can get
this from the Manor Lords Modding Community and the invite link to it can be
found from [Psiae's in Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/manorlords/mods/229).
